            In 2010, studies showed that there is 275 million metric tons of plastic waste in the oceans. One metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds. That means in 2015, there was 606,375,000,000 pounds of plastic in the oceans. The plastic then puts the lives
            of the sea animals in danger. Oftentimes, fish will digest the plastic and seafood lovers are then eating plastic essentially The goal of High Seas is to clear the plastic which is polluting the waters. We are not focused on bettering one
            ocean, our goal is to make all oceans an enjoyable place for humans and sea creatures alike. Profit collected from the clothing is then donated to our partner charities. The remaining funds are used to keep food on the table for our employees
            and make sure we continue releasing collections.
